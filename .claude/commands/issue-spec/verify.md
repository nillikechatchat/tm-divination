# Issue Spec Verify

Use when the user asks for /issue-spec:verify, issue-spec verify, or final readiness evidence before merge/archive.

## Steps

1. Run focused project tests and record evidence in VERIFY comments. Generate VERIFY bodies with issue-spec comment generate --type VERIFY --input-file verify.json instead of hand-writing Markdown, and reference the covered SPEC IDs so final verify can confirm coverage.
2. Run issue-spec verify-links --repo nillikechatchat/tm-divination --proposal <issue> --design <issue> --implement <issue> --json.
3. Render a durable spec draft:

       issue-spec archive durable-spec --repo nillikechatchat/tm-divination --proposal <issue> --capability <capability> --output /tmp/<capability>-spec.md --json

4. Run final verify:

       issue-spec verify --repo nillikechatchat/tm-divination --proposal <issue> --design <issue> --implement <issue> --pr <pr> --durable-spec /tmp/<capability>-spec.md --json

5. Final verify must fail if blocking questions, missing links, missing PROCESS rationale, open P0/P1 findings, failed or pending PR checks, or durable spec omissions exist.

## Project Workflow

- Workflow Source: `builtin`
- Workflow Schema: `issue-spec`
- Workflow Diagnostics:

Project workflow templates are declarative only. Active proposal, design, implement, SPEC, TASK, PROCESS, QUESTION, REVIEW, and VERIFY artifacts remain in GitHub issue-native storage; durable specs are repository files created during archive.
