# Issue Spec Workflow

Use this skill for issue-native OpenSpec work. Active change artifacts live in GitHub issues and issue comments; durable specs are repository files created after implementation merge.

## Start

1. Run issue-spec auth status --json and confirm the active auth source and GitHub backend.
2. Run issue-spec status --repo nillikechatchat/tm-divination --proposal <issue> --design <issue> --implement <issue> --json when issues already exist.
3. For new work, create proposal, design, and implement issues with issue-spec issue create and pass --body-file with concrete markdown content.
4. When an issue body changes, update it in place with issue-spec issue update --body-file and include --summary for the human-readable audit trail.
5. Store requirements, tasks, process ownership, review, and verify evidence as typed comments.

## Project Workflow Config

- Run issue-spec workflow validate --repo nillikechatchat/tm-divination --json before relying on project templates or legacy OpenSpec workflow definitions.
- issue-spec/config.yaml is the preferred project workflow config. If it is absent, openspec/config.yaml can be reused as a legacy workflow definition source.
- Project schemas live under issue-spec/schemas/<schema>/schema.yaml with templates in templates/*.md. Legacy OpenSpec schemas are read from openspec/schemas/<schema>/schema.yaml only in compatibility mode.
- Active workflow artifacts remain issue-native even when a legacy OpenSpec schema declares file-oriented outputs such as proposal.md, specs/**/*.md, tasks.md, review.md, or verify.md.
- Template rendering cannot weaken typed comment wrapping or canonical SPEC validation.

## GitHub Backend

- Local agents may rely on native GitHub CLI support: when no ISSUE_SPEC_TOKEN, GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN, keyring token, or issue-spec config token is present and gh auth status --active succeeds for the target host, issue-spec auto-selects the gh backend.
- Explicit env or stored issue-spec tokens keep the rest backend under auto selection. Set ISSUE_SPEC_GITHUB_BACKEND=rest or ISSUE_SPEC_GITHUB_BACKEND=gh only when a workflow needs deterministic backend selection.
- The gh backend proxies GitHub API operations through gh api and uses gh --hostname for Enterprise hosts. It does not replace local git commands.
- ISSUE_SPEC_API_URL applies to the rest backend. Forced gh mode should be used only with hosts that gh can address.
- Use ISSUE_SPEC_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" only for older issue-spec versions or when deliberately forcing rest while sourcing the token from gh.

## Rules

- Use issue-spec comment generate to render canonical typed comment bodies (SPEC, TASK, PROCESS, REVIEW, VERIFY) from structured JSON instead of hand-writing Markdown; comment upsert --type SPEC validates and rejects noncanonical SPEC bodies by default, with --allow-noncanonical as a write-time migration bypass only.
- Create SPEC comments before design; each SPEC must be testable and include WHEN/THEN scenarios.
- Do not leave active proposal/design/implement issue bodies as TBD placeholders.
- Resolve blocking QUESTION comments before design/tasks, or explicitly record accepted assumptions.
- Link SPEC <-> TASK and TASK <-> PROCESS with issue-spec link.
- Each design TASK must carry an ### Execution Planning section (rendered by comment generate --type TASK): owned modules/write areas, shared touchpoints, dependency/interface assumptions, coupling class, recommended execution mode, and complexity/split guidance. comment upsert --type TASK rejects a TASK that omits it.
- Every PROCESS must record its ### Parent TASK; comment upsert --type PROCESS rejects a PROCESS without one. Serial PROCESS chains under one parent TASK are the default decomposition; each completed serial node records ### Handoff evidence for its successor. Parallelism is a gated optimization enabled only when write ownership is disjoint, not the default.
- Link every PROCESS to the implementation PR with issue-spec pr link-process.
- Before implementation PR merge, add GitHub closing links to the implementation PR body with issue-spec pr link-issues so GitHub closes the proposal/design/implement issues when the PR merges.
- Treat Agent as the logical role or workflow-assigned label. Treat Agent Session ID and Agent Session Source as artifact writer provenance, not runner resume metadata.
- When dispatching subagents, assign each subagent an explicit subagent/session id and tell it to pass that value with --agent-session to issue-spec writer commands. In Codex, CODEX_THREAD_ID may override that value as the resolved artifact writer session id; outside Codex, --agent-session is the explicit fallback and missing session metadata is non-strict by default.
- In runner mode, runner.public_session_id is the public /resume handle. Coordinator-authored proposal, design, implement, handoff, and update issue bodies or comments should include runner.public_session_id and /resume <public-session-id> <answer or next instruction> when available. Do not present Agent Session ID, CODEX_THREAD_ID, acpx record ids, or provider session ids as /resume handles.
- For non-trivial changes, include review PROCESS nodes in the DAG; review agents are scheduled like worker agents and can run in parallel when their review scopes are independent.
- Small changes may stay coordinator-only, but record the serial execution decision in the implement or VERIFY evidence.
- Before human review, add PR rationale comments with issue-spec pr rationale for every active PROCESS.
- Use issue-spec review finding for PR line findings and issue-spec review reply to close the original thread.
- Run issue-spec review sync and issue-spec verify before declaring ready.
- After the implementation PR merges, create the separate durable spec PR with issue-spec archive durable-spec --create-pr --close-issues, passing the proposal, design, implement, and implementation PR numbers so archive also idempotently closes any still-open active issues. Use an abstract long-lived --capability directory, inspect existing related durable specs, and regroup the generated draft by stable capability modules before merge.

## Coordinator DAG Execution

1. Plan the PROCESS DAG before dispatch: read every active TASK's ### Execution Planning metadata (coupling class, recommended execution mode, owned areas) and derive PROCESS nodes from it.
2. Default to serial PROCESS chains under one parent TASK. Treat parallelism as a gated optimization: split into parallel PROCESS nodes only when their file/module write ownership is provably disjoint.
3. Treat PROCESS comments as DAG nodes with explicit owner, parent TASK, dependencies, write or review scope, PR link, and evidence.
4. Select ready PROCESS nodes whose dependencies are done. Dispatch parallel worker nodes only when write ownership is disjoint; include each worker's assigned subagent/session id and require it to pass that id with --agent-session on supported issue-spec writer commands.
5. Each completed serial PROCESS records ### Handoff evidence (the contract/state its successor consumes) before the next node starts; record a reason when a handoff is unnecessary.
6. Dispatch review PROCESS nodes for non-trivial PRs after PR rationale exists; run review nodes in parallel only when their review scopes are independent. Route P0/P1 findings to the owner PROCESS or a dedicated repair PROCESS that follows the same serial/parallel gating.
7. Integrate completed outputs by dependency order.
8. Mark PROCESS nodes done only after implementation or review evidence and, for serial predecessors, ### Handoff evidence are recorded and blocking findings are resolved.

## Project Workflow

- Workflow Source: `builtin`
- Workflow Schema: `issue-spec`
- Workflow Diagnostics:

Project workflow templates are declarative only. Active proposal, design, implement, SPEC, TASK, PROCESS, QUESTION, REVIEW, and VERIFY artifacts remain in GitHub issue-native storage; durable specs are repository files created during archive.
